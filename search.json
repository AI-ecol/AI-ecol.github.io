    "text": "Welcome\nThis five-day training course, organized by the FRB-CESAB aims to initiate ecologists to AI concepts and tools. The course will be a mix of lectures and hands-on practice based on different data types commonly encountered in ecology. The main objective of the course is to give to the participants the autonomy that will allow them to assess which algorithms are most adapted to their own research questions, where to find them and how to adjust them to the desired question.\nFor the 2026 edition, Sonia Mai Tieo will join the team to expand the deep learning section a bit. The program might change a bit, more in terms of structure than in the contents listed below. Updates will come in spring 2026.",

    "text": "Prerequisites\nYou must have a strong programming background, at least in R.\nFamiliarity with Python is preferred, but not mandatory. In fact, to make sure that we all start on similar bases, we require that you follow these tutorials before attending the training course.\n  https://www.learnpython.org/\nUnder the “Learn the basics”, please go through all the following pages:\n• Hello, World!\n• Variables and Types\n• Lists\n• Basic Operators\n• String Formatting\n• Basic String Operations\n• Conditions\n• Loops\n• Functions\n• Classes and Objects\n• Dictionaries\n• Modules and Packages\n• Input and Output\nEach section allows you to interact with a built-in Python console where you can copy/paste and edit the commands. The sections end with a small exercise, which we recommend you do. You may navigate from one section to the other by clicking on the “next tutorial” button (you don’t have to take the test – but are welcome to if you enjoy it)\nWe will not control whether you followed the tutorial, but trust that you will to collectively ensure the group has a common base to start from",
